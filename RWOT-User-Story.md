# #RebootingWebOfTrust User Story

##### By Christopher Allen — Copyright 2017 Licensed CC-BY

*(This was originally written up as an [issue](https://github.com/w3c/vc-use-cases/issues/31) in the W3Cs Verifiable Claims Use Cases repo, with a goal of using it to create a formal use case for new pseudo-anonymous web of trust.)*

**Alice** is a 1st-generation citizen of a western country (United States, Britain, Germany), born of two immigrants from a country of significant repression (Iran, Cuba, North Korea) who are now permanent residents. Her parents were settled in a small city near the agricultural heart of the county (Mid-West United States, Midlands of Britain, Saxony of Germany) where they have become successful small business owners.

As a child she was told stories of the abuses of her parents in their country of origin, where they are now not able to return. She knows some cousins and other family members in these other countries who have told similar stories, but mostly through the internet or traveling to different countries of the diaspora of their extended family.

Both **Alice** and her parents have experienced some unkind words and minor discrimination in their newly adopted country, but largely the benefits of being in a modern western country overwhelm any disadvantages. The parents have found others to practice their religion with, which **Alice** respects but in general is more secular.

**Alice** has recently graduated with a computer science degree, and has pleased her parents by settling nearby, working for a small regional bank. Quite conservative, they have a “no social media” policy at work — a rule which is regularly broken, but there have been some others who have experienced object lessons, especially if they stand out as non-conformists.

However, the winds of populism are blowing. **Alice** has personally heard more slurs lately, seen more covered the media, and many local political parties of rising significance have publicly targeted her ethnicity, her parents religion, etc. Added to the stories of repression in her parent’s birth country, even greater stories of conflict reported by distant family members, **Alice** has some legitimate fear.

**Alice**, like most millennials, doesn’t wish to leave her head in the sand—she wishes to take a more active role in making a better world. However, she knows if she stands out from the crowd that any activism she may get involved in may not only affect her, they may affect her parents or even her extended family abroad. Increasingly **Alice** has been more careful — self-censoring social media, using end-to-end encryption software to talk to her family abroad, etc.

**Bob**, a mainstream citizen of his western country, is also worried about the rising tide of populism in his own country, and extremism in other countries. Raised by a middle-class family he has travelled widely as a young adult, and has been supported by his parents to join as an employee of a non-profit organizations. **Bob** is not a programmer, but an active user of social media and other internet technology, and has some ideas about how his non-profit could use mobile applications to serve their advocacy. He shares his ideas out in the world in a public forum.

**Alice** reads this request, and has the skills to help make such a mobile applications, but now has a dilemma. She has heard of other professional women who have been public about work and have been heavily criticized or even doxxed (gamer-gate, etc.), and doesn’t want to risk her job, or risk her family by her activities. She also doesn’t have a reputation in the developer community as a mobile programmer. She also has limited time to be able to help, thus has to be focused and careful about what she can offer.

Our use case will show how **Alice** meets **Bob** anonymously to offer help with his project. How Alice is able to demonstrate and share a positive reputation for her quality work. How **Carol** is able to use **Alice’s** software to protect herself from harm in a third-world country. How **Ted** is able to review **Bob’s** ideas and **Alice’s** work, and offer some funding to help both. How **Alice** is able to increase her reputation in her anonymously developed software to the point where she is offered a job at **Ted’s** company that pays more than her job at a conservative bank. How **Alice** is able to selectively revoke parts of her anonymity to establish her personal reputation her peers and selective colleagues, without at any time putting **Carol** and her other advocacy clients at risk.
